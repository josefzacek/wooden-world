          <p>Wooden World Products manufactures doors from only the finest materials available.</p>
          <p>Each piece is carefully inspected to ensure that the end result is a quality door uniform in color and free from defects. No veneers or fingerjoints are used in order to maintain our high standards of excellence.</p>
          <p>Since we are a custom manufacturer, we can build your solid wood door to be truly "one of a kind." Whether it’s the addition of custom glass, a unique wrought iron piece, or some raised applied moulding for that finishing touch, your door becomes uniquely yours. <p><b>Although "Custom" usually means expensive, at Wooden World, we make custom, affordable.</b></p>
